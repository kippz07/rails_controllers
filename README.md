# Controllers and Routes Lab

## Timings

45 - 90 Minutes

## Summary

Create a controller and seven RESTful routes for a book object.

The templates for the GET routes can simply contain dummy HTML.

The other routes should redirect to a suitable GET route.

You may have to look up how to redirect in a controller.

You may use the controller generator but not the scaffold generator.

## Testing

You should run the automated tests to check your progress:

```bash
rspec spec
```

## Bonus task

Research the ``resources`` method of creating restful routes in rails. See if you can implement it for the books resource
